<h1>What Inspired this?</h1>
<p>
I was already familiar with creating web applications, but I was curious to experiment with creating desktop applications. I chose Tkinter because it is cross-compatible with popular operating systems like macOS, Windows, and Linux.

Another reason I wanted to explore desktop applications is that they allow data to be stored locally, rather than in the cloud. I wanted to demonstrate that CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are possible with desktop applications.

For this project, I targeted a simple use case: storing records of books, which would include the author, title, ISBN, and year published.
